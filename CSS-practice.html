                     <p>I've been with you
 since before your birth.
 I'll stand by your side,
 as long as I'm on this earth.</p>

                     <p>A mother's love is special,
 a never-ending gift.
 A love that's always there
 if you ever need a lift.</p>

                     <p>I think of you often,
 never missing a day.
 My love is forever,
 and always sent your way.</P>

                     <p>You're never far from the caring
 thoughts in my heart.
 No matter how many miles
 ever try to keep us apart. </p>

                     <p> 
 A mother's love, your gift,
 the gift I'll always give to you.
 As we watch our lives go by,
 no matter what you say or do</p>
